## Configuration
Each job can be customized via a config file. Enable/disable job types and specify which Pokémon can perform them.

Cobbleworkers uses [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) and [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) for easy in-game tweaking
when using the minecraft integrated server, for servers use the config file.
